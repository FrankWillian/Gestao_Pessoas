# Onboarding Schedule

## Week 1

- **03/03** - The first week is intense!
  - Ideally, we want the new developer to deploy code on their first day of work. To make this possible, we have separated some small tasks - around one or two hours - and we pair program throughout the process of setting up the development environment, solving the task, and deploying to production.
  - Complete the courses "Iniciando com ASP.NET Core & Introdução ao Entity Framework Core" by Eduardo Pires. These courses have a duration of 5 hours and are available for free on the portal.
  - Complete the course "CRUD com ASP.NET Core MVC, Dapper e Injeção de Dependências" on Udemy. This course has a duration of 1 hour and a cost of R$ 39.90.
  - Observation: We pair program throughout the process. Use the CSV import task as the first task!

## Weeks 2-4

- **10/03** - Semanas 2-4
  - Starting from the second week, we begin a series of onboarding meetings with various people from the company. These meetings usually fall into three types: 1:1 to get to know someone, an overview of other teams in the company, and technical overviews of specific areas/projects. Here are some examples:
    - 1:1 with the CTO
    - 1:1 with the Engineering team
    - 1:1 with the HR team
    - Overview of UX with a UX specialist
    - Overview of the Technical Support team
  - Most of these sessions last for 50 minutes, and it is the mentor's responsibility to schedule them. The main purpose here is not to make the new developer memorize everything in such a short time, but rather to introduce them to as many people they will be interacting with on a daily basis as possible. This way, they will always have a familiar face when they need to interact with other teams and departments.
  - Complete the course "REST com ASP.NET Core WebAPI" by Eduardo Pires. This course has a duration of 13 hours and a cost of R$ 250.00.
  - Observation: Develop a pilot project using APIs.

## Weeks 5-6

- **03/04** - Semanas 5-6 - Projeto de "graduação"
  - Finally, after four intense weeks of fixing small bugs, onboarding sessions, and a pilot project (for those who were not familiar with C#/.NET), it's time to dedicate these final two weeks to the graduation project! Ideally, the mentor and mentee should have been discussing ideas for this project since week 3.
  - The purpose here is to choose a project that is a bit more complex than the small tasks that the new developer has been working on so far. The project can be either a new feature in the product or something internal, like a new tool to help the team or improve our monitoring. For example, one developer chose to restructure certain parts of our architecture as their graduation project, making them more testable.
  - Complete the course "ASP.NET Core Enterprise Applications" by Eduardo Pires. This course has a duration of 13 hours and a cost of R$ 250.00.
  - Observation: Pair program with Dalton for the development of the recipe mapping project.
